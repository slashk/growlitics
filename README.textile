h2. Growlitics

A simple ruby script that queries Google Analytics for your performance statistics and then displays them on your screen using Growl or simply to the command line.

h3. Usage

Before you can use the script, you need to set two environmental variables:
bq. @ # export GOOGLE_USERNAME="jimmy@gmail.com" @
bq. @ # export GOOGLE_PASSWORD="h0td0g!" @

Once these have been set, simply execute the script at the command line:
bq. @ # ./growlitics.rb @

The script is located in the @lib@ folder.

h3. Dependencies

This script requires the 'Garb' (for Google Analytics support) and 'ruby-growl' for Growl support.

It also probably runs only on a Mac due to the Growl dependency.

h3. To Do

* add command line options
* think about cross platform compatibility
