h2. Growlitics

A simple ruby script that queries Google Analytics for your performance statistics and then displays them on your screen using Growl or simply to the command line.

h3. Dependencies

This script requires the 'Garb' (for Google Analytics support) and 'ruby-growl' for Growl support.

It also probably runs only on a Mac due to the Growl dependency.

h3. To Do

* add command line options
* think about cross platform compatibility
